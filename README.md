# Personal-Assistant-for-Linux-Python
This repository will host the personal assistant for Linux system created using Python programming language.

This project requires a ppn file. Personally I create a hotword named 'Natalie' using site: https://console.picovoice.ai/ppn

Also this project assumes you have audacious already installed.
